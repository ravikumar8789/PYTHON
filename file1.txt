As per Shiv Mahapuran, once Brahma (the God of creation) and Vishnu (the  God of Preservation) had an argument in terms of 
supremacy of creation. To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. Vishnu 
and Brahma split their ways to downwards and upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either directions. Brahma lied 
that he found out the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as a second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he
 would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped till the end of eternity.
